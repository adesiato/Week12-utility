# Incremental Build Model

# Week 12 - Part A

The incramental build model was utilized when creating each separate function.
As soon as I would finish one, I would push the current version of my code to my GitHub Repository.
By doing so, I am now able to go back and see the changes I made in my code at each point.
There is also a cloud-backed version of my code, making it much more reliable than my computer hard drive for access purposes.
